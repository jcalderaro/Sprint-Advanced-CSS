Demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering the following free-form questions.

#1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?

    Adaptive uses several distinct layouts for different screen sizes using breakpoints. 
    Where as Responsive it built more fluidly within one layout, to look good no matter what size the viewport is.


#2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.

    Mobile first means you build the mobile site first, then build up in viewport size to desktop. 
    Desktop first you build the desktop site first, then build down in viewport size to mobile.

    It makes every 1rem equal 10px making sizing math easy.

     Its an additional program that increases ease of use.
    While also adding additional properties that wouldn't otherwise be available to you in CSS.
